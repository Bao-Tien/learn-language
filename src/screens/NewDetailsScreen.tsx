        A HCMC trial proposal to tax property owners on second homes is in line with international
        practices, but insiders don’t agree on how and when the plan should be implemented. Vo Hong
        Thang, R&D deputy director of DKRA Vietnam, said it is necessary to develop a more specific
        roadmap before imposing the second home tax. It might take 2 or 3 years before the market is
        ready for such a tax, and even then it should only be applied in big cities like HCMC,
        Hanoi, Da Nang and Can Tho, Thanh Nien newspaper quoted Thang as saying. Thang argued that
        an effective tax payer database should be completed first to clearly identify those who own
        more than one property. The U.S. and China have specific regulations on the amount and type
        of real estate an individual can own before paying extra property taxes, he noted. At first,
        Vietnam should tax properties in central business districts where real estate owners are
        well-off, he proposed, adding that a progressive tax rate would be best, for example: 2% for
        the second home, 5% the third, and 10% the fourth. "In the U.S., despite the property tax,
        many people still own many houses to rent. Tax rates should be appropriate to limit
        speculation and the number of properties left unused," he argued. "And the charges should
        not be too high to avoid suffocating the real estate market," he said. "If the intervention
        in the market is too rough, it will negatively affect dozens of other industries." Thang
        emphasized that tax rates should be lower than the profit margins of leasing houses, noting
        that many people, especially salaried employees and retirees, buy houses to rent in order to
        help cover their living costs. Tran Minh Hoang, deputy secretary general of the Vietnam
        Association of Realtors, said for the plan to work, first home buyers must also be granted a
        preferential policy. He said that now is not the right time to levy the tax because the real
        estate market is frozen and additional expenses for buyers could cause a panic and sink the
        market. "It’s uncertain whether or not the tax would push property prices down, so it is
        necessary to carefully consider the tax rate," he continued. "In many countries, the tax
        rate on second homes and onwards is a slightly higher to prevent speculation, and avoid
        flooding the real estate market with money, Hoang elaborated. "Therefore, the tax should be
        applied throughout the country, not only in HCMC," Hoang said. Real estate expert Nguyen
        Hoang said the second home tax would help reduce real estate speculation, but the main
        purpose would be to increase budget revenues, while also partly helping to make real estate
        transactions more transparent. "Collecting a second home tax is now possible because the
        database of resident information is basically complete," he pointed out. "However, taxation
        needs to be specific, clear and fair across regions, for example, between the inner city and
        the outskirts, urban areas and rural ones, properties used for residence and for production
        or business." Another real estate expert said the second home tax may become a burden for
        relevant stakeholders because real estate is already subject to many taxes and fees such as
        land use, corporate income tax, property transfer tax, and registration fees. HCMC
        authorities have been saying recently that the city’s income could be increased by
        collecting taxes for land use and real estate ownership on property owners who own more than
        one piece of real estate. The idea is to prevent speculation, the abandonment of property
        and the waste of resources. Taxing second homes is common practice in many other countries,
        but Vietnam currently levies no property tax on second properties. Dang Hung Vo, a former
        deputy minister of natural resources and environment, estimated since the doi moi (Renewal)
        economic reforms began in the 1980s, land prices have multiplied 300-400 times.
